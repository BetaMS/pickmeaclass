Pick me a class is a simple web application that works kind of like a flow chart.

The application continuely asks questions, allowing the user to pick between 2 answers until they are given a DnD 5e class that fits with the questions asked.

It was designed with new players in mind, the questions being simple and focused on encompassing the entire class to help with class picking.
