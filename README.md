<h2>Pick Me A Class</h2>

Pick me a class is a simple web application that works kind of like a flow chart.

The application continuely asks questions, allowing the user to pick between 2 answers until they are given a DnD 5e class that fits with the questions asked.

On completion you'll be able to see it up and running at www.pickmeaclass.com
